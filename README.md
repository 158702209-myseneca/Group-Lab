Rock, Paper, or Scissors? The three respected outcomes of this game is either a draw, loss, or a win. Played between two players.

This is a game which revolves around two players that draw either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Typically rounds are conducted as the best of three. Rock is superior to Scissors, Paper is superior to Rock, while Scissors is superior to paper. Should a player choose Rock, and the opposing player chooses scissors. That opposing player would lose the round. The same idea applies for the following rules listed above. Should players agree to play up to the best of three, the game ends once a player wins twice.
